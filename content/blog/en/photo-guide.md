# Perfect Portrait Photography Guide

Photo quality is crucial for getting the most accurate AI analysis results. Here are professional photography tips recommended by experts.

## Basic Photography Principles

### Front-Facing Shots Are Best
- **Angle**: within 15 degrees left or right from center
- **Head position**: avoid tilting up or down
- **Eye level**: camera at subject's eye level

### Optimal Distance
- **Full face**: face fills 60-80% of frame
- **Too close**: distorts facial proportions
- **Too far**: insufficient detail for analysis

## Lighting Setup Guide

### Natural Light (Recommended)
**Best Times**
- **Morning**: 9-11 AM soft light
- **Afternoon**: 2-4 PM indirect sunlight
- **Overcast days**: even, diffused lighting

**Window Light Tips**
- Face the subject toward a large window
- Avoid direct harsh sunlight
- Use sheer curtains to soften light

### Indoor Artificial Lighting

**LED Panel Lights**
- Position 45 degrees above subject
- Use daylight-balanced bulbs (5500K)
- Add fill light to reduce shadows

**Ring Light Setup**
- Place camera in center of ring
- Adjust intensity to avoid overexposure
- Maintain comfortable distance

## Camera Settings

### Essential Settings
- **Resolution**: minimum 1920×1080 (2MP+)
- **Focus**: sharp focus on eyes
- **ISO**: keep low (100-400) for less noise
- **Shutter speed**: fast enough to avoid blur

### Smartphone Tips
- **Portrait mode**: use if available
- **HDR off**: for consistent exposure
- **Grid lines**: help with composition
- **Clean lens**: wipe before shooting

## Composition Guidelines

### Face Positioning
- **Center the face** in frame
- **Leave headroom**: small space above head
- **Include shoulders**: for natural appearance

### Background Considerations
- **Solid colors**: white, gray, or neutral tones
- **Avoid patterns**: distracting textures
- **Sufficient contrast**: face stands out clearly

## Expression and Pose

### Facial Expression
- **Natural smile** or neutral expression
- **Relaxed features**: avoid tension
- **Open eyes**: fully visible, not squinting
- **Closed mouth**: prevents teeth reflection

### Head Position
- **Straight alignment**: ears level
- **Slight forward lean**: engaging posture
- **Chin position**: parallel to ground

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Lighting Errors
❌ **Harsh shadows** under eyes or nose
❌ **Backlighting** making face too dark
❌ **Mixed lighting** sources with different colors
❌ **Flash photography** creating unflattering shadows

### Composition Problems
❌ **Tilted horizon** or uneven framing
❌ **Too much background** space
❌ **Cutting off** top of head
❌ **Off-center positioning** without purpose

### Technical Issues
❌ **Blurry images** from camera shake
❌ **Overexposure** losing facial detail
❌ **Low resolution** insufficient for analysis
❌ **Heavy compression** reducing quality

## Advanced Techniques

### Professional Portrait Setup

**Three-Point Lighting**
1. **Key light**: main illumination (45° angle)
2. **Fill light**: reduces shadows (opposite side)
3. **Rim light**: separates subject from background

**Reflector Usage**
- **White reflector**: gentle fill light
- **Silver reflector**: more dramatic contrast
- **Gold reflector**: warm skin tones

### Post-Processing Tips

**Basic Adjustments Only**
- ✅ **Brightness/contrast**: minor corrections
- ✅ **Color balance**: natural skin tones
- ❌ **Heavy filters**: avoid artificial looks
- ❌ **Skin smoothing**: preserves natural features

## Equipment Recommendations

### Camera Options
**Professional**
- DSLR or mirrorless camera
- 85mm or 105mm portrait lens
- External flash with diffuser

**Budget-Friendly**
- Recent smartphone (3+ years old)
- Clip-on LED light
- Phone tripod for stability

**Essential Accessories**
- **Tripod**: for sharp, consistent shots
- **Remote shutter**: prevents camera shake
- **Reflector**: improves lighting quality

## Pre-Shoot Checklist

### Subject Preparation
- [ ] Hair away from face
- [ ] Minimal, natural makeup
- [ ] Remove glasses (if possible)
- [ ] Clean, wrinkle-free clothing

### Equipment Check
- [ ] Camera battery charged
- [ ] Memory card with space
- [ ] Lens cleaned
- [ ] Lighting setup tested

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Background prepared
- [ ] Lighting positioned
- [ ] Camera height adjusted
- [ ] Test shots reviewed

## Quality Assessment

### Technical Review
- **Sharpness**: eyes in perfect focus
- **Exposure**: balanced highlights and shadows
- **Color**: natural skin tones
- **Noise**: minimal grain or pixelation

### Composition Check
- **Framing**: face properly positioned
- **Angle**: straight, front-facing view
- **Background**: clean and undistracting
- **Overall**: professional appearance

## Special Considerations

### Children's Photos
- **Shorter sessions**: maintain attention
- **Natural play**: capture genuine expressions
- **Parent assistance**: keep child comfortable
- **Multiple shots**: increase success rate

### Group Photos
- **Individual shots preferred**: better analysis
- **Equal lighting**: consistent across faces
- **Clear separation**: avoid overlapping faces
- **Same distance**: all subjects equidistant

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Blurry Photos
- **Cause**: camera shake or wrong focus
- **Solution**: use tripod, check autofocus

### Dark/Light Photos
- **Cause**: incorrect exposure settings
- **Solution**: adjust ISO, aperture, or lighting

### Unflattering Shadows
- **Cause**: harsh or poorly positioned lighting
- **Solution**: use diffusion, add fill light

### Color Casts
- **Cause**: mixed lighting temperatures
- **Solution**: consistent light sources, white balance

Following these guidelines will help you capture high-quality portraits perfect for AI analysis. Remember, practice makes perfect – take multiple shots and choose the best ones!
